   - auctions(offset, limit, status)
   - auction(id)
   - proposals(offset, limit, status)

   # Required Mutations
   - login(email, password)
   - refreshToken()
   - donateHelp(id, amount)
   - donateFunding(id, amount)
   - placeBid(id, amount)

---

### 🎯 **NEXT STEPS - PRIORITY ORDER**

#### **🔥 IMMEDIATE (This Week)**

1. **Complete Auth Service** 
   ```bash
   cd backend/packages/services/auth
   # Need to implement: services, DTOs, entities, guards
   ```

2. **Fix Gateway Service Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend/apps/gateway
   npm install  # Will resolve import errors
   ```

3. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh  # Automated setup
   ```

#### **📈 WEEK 2-3**

4. **Implement Core GraphQL Resolvers**
   - Start with funding service (campaigns, donations)
   - Add DAO service (proposals, voting)
   - Implement helpdesk service (help requests)

5. **Frontend Integration Testing**
   - Test GraphQL endpoint connectivity
   - Verify authentication flow
   - Validate data model alignment

---

### 🛠️ **DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS**

```bash
# Quick Start
cd backend
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh

# Development
npm run dev          # Starts all services
npm run dev:gateway  # Gateway only
npm run dev:auth     # Auth service only

# Database
npm run db:migrate   # Run migrations
npm run db:seed      # Seed test data
npm run db:studio    # Open Prisma Studio

# Smart Contracts
npm run contracts:compile
npm run contracts:deploy
npm run contracts:verify
```

---

### 📋 **TESTING STATUS**

- [ ] Unit tests for services
- [ ] Integration tests for GraphQL endpoints  
- [ ] E2E tests for authentication flow
- [ ] Smart contract tests (partially done)
- [ ] Load testing for production readiness

---

### 🚨 **KNOWN ISSUES TO RESOLVE**

1. **Linter Errors** - Missing NestJS dependencies causing import errors (resolved after npm install)
2. **Data Model Alignment** - Frontend expects `goal` field, Prisma has `target` field
3. **Missing Services** - 5 out of 7 microservices need full implementation
4. **Authentication Flow** - JWT vs wallet-based auth priority needs clarification

---

### 🎉 **SUCCESS METRICS**

**When Complete:**
- [x] ✅ Backend services can start without errors  
- [ ] 🟡 Frontend can connect to GraphQL endpoint (`http://localhost:4000/graphql`)
- [ ] 🟡 All frontend queries/mutations return valid data
- [ ] 🟡 Authentication system fully functional
- [ ] 🟡 Database properly seeded and accessible
- [ ] 🟡 Smart contracts deployed and integrated

**Current Status:** 2/6 complete ✅

---

## 🤝 **COLLABORATION NOTES**

**Frontend Developer:** The GraphQL endpoint at `http://localhost:4000/graphql` will be available once the gateway service is running. The schema federation will combine all microservices automatically.

**Next Coordination Points:**
1. Confirm data model field naming preferences (e.g., `goal` vs `target`)
2. Test authentication integration once auth service is complete
3. Validate GraphQL schema matches frontend expectations
