DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db" npx prisma db push --schema=packages/libs/prisma/schema.prisma
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db" npx prisma db seed --schema=packages/libs/prisma/schema.prisma

# Start all services
npm run dev
```

### Service Endpoints:

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Service Communication**
- **GraphQL Federation**: Services expose subgraphs that are federated at the gateway
- **NATS JetStream**: Event-driven communication between services
- **Database**: Shared Prisma schema with service-specific access patterns

### **Security Features**
- JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation
- Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- CORS configuration for frontend integration
- Rate limiting and security headers

### **GraphQL Schema**
All services expose GraphQL endpoints with the operations the frontend expects:

```graphql
# Authentication
mutation login($email: String!, $password: String!): LoginResponse
mutation register($input: RegisterInput!): LoginResponse
mutation refreshToken($token: String!): RefreshTokenResponse

# Governance  
query proposals($offset: Int, $limit: Int, $status: ProposalStatus): ProposalConnection
mutation castVote($input: CastVoteInput!): Vote

# Funding
query fundingRounds($offset: Int, $limit: Int, $status: CampaignStatus): CampaignConnection
mutation donateFunding($id: ID!, $amount: Float!): Donation

# Help Requests
query helpRequests($offset: Int, $limit: Int, $status: String): HelpRequestConnection
mutation donateHelp($id: ID!, $amount: Float!): Donation

# Auctions
query auctions($offset: Int, $limit: Int, $status: String): AuctionConnection
mutation placeBid($id: ID!, $amount: Float!): Bid
```

## 🌐 **FRONTEND INTEGRATION**

### **GraphQL Endpoint**
The frontend's `codegen.yml` expects: `http://localhost:4000/graphql` ✅

### **Expected Operations**  
All GraphQL operations the frontend uses have been implemented:
- ✅ `helpRequests`, `helpRequest`, `donateHelp`
- ✅ `fundingRounds`, `fundingRound`, `donateFunding`  
- ✅ `auctions`, `auction`, `placeBid`
- ✅ `proposals`, `castVote`
- ✅ `login`, `refreshToken`

### **Data Model Alignment**
Field names and structures match frontend expectations:
- ✅ `target` instead of `goal`
- ✅ `creator` instead of `owner`
- ✅ `donations` array with user details
- ✅ Proper enum values for status fields
